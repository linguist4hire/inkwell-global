            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <h3>Bridging Language, Culture, and Business</h3>
          <p><br>With a background in linguistics and a deep appreciation for the power of communication, I’ve spent years helping businesses navigate cross-cultural environments with clarity and confidence.</p>

<p>Working across the United States and throughout Greater China — including Mainland China and Hong Kong — I’ve developed a strong understanding of the nuances that shape successful international partnerships.</p>

<p>What started as a passion for language naturally evolved into a broader mission: empowering organizations to connect across borders, bridge cultural gaps, and grow globally.</p>
<p>Inkwell Global Advisory was born out of this vision, building on the foundation of my U.S.-based company, My WordShop, LLC.</p>

<p>Today, I advise businesses on effective communication, cultural strategy, and market expansion — with a focus on helping teams collaborate and thrive in a globalized world.</p>
